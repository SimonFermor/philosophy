### What Is Hard Determinism?
Hard determinism is the idea that we are nothing more than physical bodies entirely determined by the laws of nature.  We are "matter in motion".

Pierre Simon LaPlace claimed that the location and motion of every object in the universe can be predicted if we know the current location and motion of every object.

### Summary
Benjamin Libet experimented in the 1980s to investigate whether hand movements happened after the conscious decision to move one's hand.

He used an EEG machine to measure brain activity and found that brain activity occured hundreds of millisecconds before the conscious decision to move the hand.

In other words movement started before the individual will could decide to do so.

### Conclusion
Some take this as evidence that free will is an illusion.

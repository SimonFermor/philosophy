### What Is Fatalism?
Fatalism is the belief that our fate is pre-determined and that whatever we think or decide has no influence on this pre-ordained fate.

### Greek Origins
The ancient Greeks believed that humans were at the mercy of the gods and that the gods determined their fate.

Characters in the Greek tragedies attempt to control their fate but whatever they do their end is predetermined.

### Oedipus
The story of Oedipus illustrates ancient Greek beliefs about how ones fate is determined by the gods.

Socrates: seeking of wisdom is the essence of philosphy

# Socrates
470-399 BC

View of life: **Know thyself** (from Delphi inscription)

Taught that "the unexamined life is not worth living"

Thought that people in Athens were only interested in cleverness and demagoguery

The Clouds by Aristophanes poked fun at Socrates, leading to our expression "having his head in the clouds"

Brought to trial for corrupting the youth and not believing in the gods of the city

Refused to abandon his convictions even is this meant being convicted with a death sentence

Crito wanted to help him escape.  Socrates argued that he had lived in the city for many years and accepted the benefits of doing so and the city laws and so should not now break with the city.

### Thought Experiment
Jim in south America and comes across soldiers with 20 native people.  Jim is asked to shoot one native and soldiers will then not shoot them all.

Utilitarianism demands that Jim should shoot one native. Williams rejects this and says that Jim should not need to get blood on his hands - he argues that no moral theory should demand a person get blood on his hands.

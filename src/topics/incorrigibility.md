Incorrigible means to be impossible to correct or change.  In the context of philosophy incorrigibility is used to refer to what is experienced in the mind and how the experience cannot be corrected.  The experience is incorrigible.  The conscious experience may be imagined and so not be reality, but it is an immediate experience in the mind and in this sense is incorrigible.

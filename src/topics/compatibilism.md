Compatiblists believe that the world and outcomes are deterministic and also that there is free will. Compatibilists do not see a contradiction between determism and free will.

Compatibilists believe that decision making by the individual has an affect on the future.

### Free-Will
Also known as soft determinism, compatibilism allows for free will decision making and moral responsibility.

### Second-Order Desires
Frankfurt considered that second-order desires (wanting aligned first-order desires) are the key differentiator between a person and a wanton.  With this distinction, a person can be deterministic and at the same time have free will.

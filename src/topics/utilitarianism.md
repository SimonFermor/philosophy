### What Is Utilitarianism?
Utilitarians are ethical theorists who consider that any good moral rule should give the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.

An action is only morally permissible if it produces the greatest net happiness and the least suffering compared to any other action.  This is the principle of utility.

Good consequences follow from good actions.

The ultimate end for utilitarianism is happiness.

Utilitarians wanted an intuitive basis for moral action and this is provided by considering happiness as the end objective for all decisions.

Viewed as an hedonistic moral theory.  However, it is not egoistic pleasure seeking, instead it is other regarding.

### Origins
Jeremy Bentham in 1789: An introduction to the principles of morals and legislation.

### Value Theory
Only thing that matters is happniness and the absense of suffering.  Money is only of value as a way to get happiness.

### Right Action Theory
The right action is the one that maximizes what is valuable.

### Example
6 patients needing a drug and there are only 5 doses.  1 patient needs 5 doses, others only need 1.  Utilitarianism would say that 5 patients needing 1 dose should be given the drug as this maximizes happiness.

### Kant
Utilitarianism can be contrasted with the views of Kant.  For Kant the intent was important.  For utilitarianism the results or consequences are important.

### Utilitarian Decision Making
Choosing the action that makes the most happiness does not always lead to a good choice for anyone.  For example choosing a restaurant for a group.

### Act Utilitarianism
Should take the act giving the greatest good for the greatest number.  For example doctor should kill neighbour to use organs to save multiple others.

### Rule Utilitarianism
Long term and larger scale thinking - should make decisions that maximize utility in the majority of times.  Killing a neighbour for their organs works in the short term but does not serve society in the long term.

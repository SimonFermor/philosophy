### What Is Morality?
Morality is the set of rules that govern our actions.

Alternative approaches:
- take account of others in deciding what we ought to do
- entirely self-interest based (egoism)
- good for it's own sake (rational)

The Ten Commandments are an example of moral rules.

### From Above
Most moral rules come from above: God, parents, outside rules

### Plato's Euthyphro
Question raised in this dialogue: Should we follow God's laws just because they are His or, rather, because His laws are good?

### Conscience
What is the role of our conscience? How does our conscience decide what is right and wrong?

### Autonomy
Immanuel Kant was of the view that morality is based on autonomy.  The individual has the ability to decide what is right and wrong.

### Key Moralists
Aristotle - morality is about being virtuous
Hume and Rousseau - a matter of feeling
Kant - morality is entirely reason based
Utilitarians - morality is based on rules of thumb (happiness for the greatest number)
Nietzsche (existentialists) - custom, societal, choice based
Feminist - interpersonal relationships (vs principles and procedures)

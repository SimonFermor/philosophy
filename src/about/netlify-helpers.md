## Add some Netlify helpers
Netlify Dev adds the ability to use Netlify redirects, proxies, and serverless functions.

```bash
# install the Netlify CLI in order to get Netlify Dev
npm install -g netlify-cli

# run a local server with some added Netlify sugar in front of Eleventy
netlify dev
```

A serverless functions pipeline is included via Netlify Dev. By running `netlify dev` you'll be able to execute any of your serverless functions directly like this:

- [/.netlify/functions/hello](/.netlify/functions/hello)
- [/.netlify/functions/fetch-joke](/.netlify/functions/fetch-joke)

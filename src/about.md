## Existence
So long as I keep updating this site I'm thinking and I exist.

If I stop updating the site do I still exist? If someone else updates the site do I still exist?  Is it sufficient that while I'm reading this page I exist?

Do I need to continue leaving a trail on the Internet to exist?

If I visit another web site, does this site still exist?  Prove it!

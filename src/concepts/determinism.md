### What Is Determinism?
The thesis of determinism is that the laws of nature fully determine everything that happens.  Every state and event is determined by prior states and events.

### How Is Determinism Different From Fatalism?
Fatalism is different in that it is based on our fate being pre-determined and not based on particular actions or the current state of the physical world.

### Are Our Actions Compelled?
Some forms of determinism allow for human thought and decision making to affect the outcome.

### Can Our Actions Be Determined And Free
In a deterministic world what we do is determined by the laws of nature.  This can include human actions and reactions to external events.  There are a number of interpretations of determinism and whether this allows for free action:

1. Soft Determinism - compatiblists believe free action is possible in a deterministic world

2. Libertarian - the belief that there is free action and so the world is indeterministic

3. Incompatiblists - the belief that there can be no free action in a deterministic world

4. Hard Determinism - the belief that determinism precludes any free action
